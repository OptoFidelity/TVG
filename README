This is the source code distribution of OptoFidelity Test Video Generator.
Use it only if you want to compile TVG yourself - there are binary distributions
available at https://github.com/OptoFidelity/TVG/releases

Compiling (for Windows 64-bit target, on 64-bit Linux host):

1. Checkout newest cerbero from Git repo.
   Note: do not place it directly in ~, because ~/cerbero will be used for
         temp files during build.
   
   mkdir ~/dev; cd ~/dev
   git clone https://github.com/OptoFidelity/cerbero.git
   # (You can also use upstream git://anongit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/sdk/cerbero)
   cd cerbero

2. Bootstrap and build gstreamer:
   ./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-win64.cbc bootstrap
   ./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-win64.cbc package gstreamer-1.0
   Errors about WiX in packaging stage can be ignored, as we do not use the MSI
   packages.

3. Checkout the oftvg repo.

4. Build oftvg using the included config file
   ./cerbero-uninstalled -c ~/oftvg/cerbero/cross-win64.cbc build oftvg 

5. Run the packaging script:
   distribution/make_windows_pkg.sh ~/cerbero/dist/windows_x86_64

Compiling (for Linux 64-bit target, on 64-bit Linux host):

1. Checkout newest cerbero from Git repo.
   Note: do not place it directly in ~, because ~/cerbero will be used for
         temp files during build.
   
   mkdir ~/dev; cd ~/dev
   git clone https://github.com/OptoFidelity/cerbero.git
   # (You can also use upstream git://anongit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/sdk/cerbero)
   cd cerbero

2. Bootstrap and build gstreamer:
   ./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/linux.config bootstrap
   ./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/linux.config package gstreamer-1.0

3. Checkout the oftvg repo.

4. Build oftvg using the included config file
   ./cerbero-uninstalled -c ~/oftvg/cerbero/linux.config build oftvg 

5. Run the packaging script:
   distribution/make_linux_pkg.sh ~/cerbero/dist/linux_x86_64

Note that the distribution version you use to build will determine the minimum
system requirements for the built package. For example, it will not run with
an older version of glibc.
