This is the source code distribution of OptoFidelity Test Video Generator.
Use it only if you want to compile TVG yourself - there are binary distributions
available at http://code.google.com/p/oftvg/downloads/list.

Compiling:

1. Checkout newest cerbero from Git repo.
   Note: do not place it directly in ~, because ~/cerbero will be used for
         temp files during build.
   
   mkdir ~/dev; cd ~/dev
   git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer-sdk/cerbero
   cd cerbero

2. Bootstrap for the platform that you are interested in:
   ./cerbero-uninstalled â€“c config/cross-win64.cbc bootstrap

3. Checkout the oftvg repo.

4. Build oftvg using the included config file
   ./cerbero-uninstalled -c ~/oftvg/cerbero/cross-win64.cbc build oftvg
